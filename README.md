# OS Installation
The assignment details the installation of Debian 12 on VMware Workstation, highlighting its benefits for learning, development, and testing in a virtualized environment.

It provides step-by-step instructions for creating a VM, configuring hardware, and completing the Debian installation, including partitioning and software selection.

The document emphasizes the advantages of using VMware, such as snapshots, isolation, and portability, while noting performance limitations compared to bare-metal setups.

Hardware and software requirements are clearly outlined, ensuring smooth operation of the VM, with recommendations for optimal performance.

The conclusion underscores Debian's stability and VMware's flexibility, making this setup ideal for educational and experimental purposes.

## System Call
The assignment explains system calls as the bridge between user-space programs and the Linux kernel, enabling privileged operations like file and process management.

It outlines steps to implement a custom system call in Debian, including installing development tools and downloading the kernel source code.

A practical example is provided, demonstrating how to create a system call function that writes a message to the kernel log.

The process involves modifying kernel source files, compiling the kernel, and testing the new system call, offering hands-on experience with kernel development.

This section reinforces the importance of system calls in OS functionality and provides a foundational understanding for advanced Linux kernel customization.
